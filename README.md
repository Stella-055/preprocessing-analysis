# Dataset Preprocessing Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains various datasets for the insider threat aimed at analyzing the impact of different preprocessing techniques on model performance. The goal is to compare and evaluate how preprocessing methods such as standardization, encoding, SMOTE, PCA, and feature selection influence accuracy and overall model effectiveness.

## Datasets
The repository includes multiple datasets, each varying in structure and domain, to provide a broad perspective on preprocessing effects. Some datasets may contain numerical, categorical, or imbalanced data requiring different preprocessing approaches.

## Preprocessing Techniques Covered
1. **Baseline (Raw Data Performance)** – Evaluating model accuracy before any preprocessing.
2. **Standardization** – Scaling numerical features to improve model convergence.
3. **Encoding** – Converting categorical data into numerical format.
4. **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)** – Addressing class imbalance.
5. **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** – Reducing dimensionality while preserving variance.
6. **Feature Selection** – Identifying the most relevant features for the model.

## Experimentation Process
For each dataset:
1. Train a baseline model on raw data.
2. Apply each preprocessing technique separately and track accuracy changes.
3. Compare results to identify the most effective preprocessing methods.


## Goals
- Understand the role of preprocessing in machine learning.
- Identify which preprocessing techniques improve model performance.
- Compare preprocessing effects across different datasets.
